Assume you're using a respeaker_usb_4_mic_array (v2).
```
docker pull ghcr.io/bigjohnn/docker-odas:latest
git clone git@github.com:BigJohnn/odas.git
cd docker
sudo docker compose up
```

tty1:
```
docker exec -it docker-odas-1 /bin/bash
python3 DOA_sound.py
```

tty2:
```
docker exec -it docker-odas-1 /bin/bash
sudo ./build/bin/odaslive -c config/odaslive/respeaker_usb_4_mic_array.cfg
```

Enjoy!

Or you can build it from scratch, please read the codes in docker_dev and/or docker_runtime for more information. 

ODAS 
====

ODAS stands for Open embeddeD Audition System. This is a library dedicated to perform sound source localization, tracking, separation and post-filtering. ODAS is coded entirely in C, for more portability, and is optimized to run easily on low-cost embedded hardware. ODAS is free and open source.

The [ODAS wiki](https://github.com/introlab/odas/wiki) describes how to build and run the software.

ROS: Please visite the [odas_ros project](https://github.com/introlab/odas_ros).
